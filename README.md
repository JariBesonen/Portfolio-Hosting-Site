# Portfolio Host Site

This is my personal portfolio host site built with React and deployed on Vercel. It presents a curated selection of my projects with clear technical highlights, links to live demos and source code, and a simple way to contact me.

The site is designed as a single-page, scroll-based layout with a focus on clean typography, performance, and a polished UI. Content is data-driven where possible to keep updates simple and maintainable.
